# Project Name
House price prediction by building model in Ridge and Lasso regression model building method.

## Table of Contents
* This is EDA and Linear Model building with regularisation techniques Ridge and Lasso project where we analyse various parameters that affect prices of houses.
    Mostly process followed are data  understanding ,cleaning  manipulation,analysis,model building,regularisation ,model validation and presentation
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas,seaborn,sklearn,statsmodels and matplotlib are fantastic libraries that speed up EDA.
* Upgrad staff and peers

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- This is EDA and Linear Model building with regularisation project where we analyse various parameters that affect prices of houses.
- To understand model building using Linear regression with regularisation techniques of Ridge and Lasso
- To understand paramaters that affect proces of houses and how they help in building model.
- Linear regression with regularisation for model building and validation.

Reularisation using both lasso and ridge method prevent overfitting of model.

Manual feature selection will not be able to prevent overfitting to the extent done by Lasso and Ridge techniques.

Manual feature selection is leading to overfitting.Ridge and Lasso help in getting R2 of 0.95 on train and 0.85 on test data.

Lasso and Ridge are able to describe approximately 85% of data

Ridge optimal alpha/lambda value is 0.1

Lasso optimal alpha/lambda value is 50
